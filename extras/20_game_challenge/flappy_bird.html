                <p>
                    Overall, Pong was not that difficult to complete. I've already had a little bit of
                    experience with the Godot engine before so most of the time spent wokring on this game
                    was just refamiliarizing myself with the various nodes and functions.

                    To set up the main game scene, I added a <code>ColorRect</code> node and colored it black, then set the
                    "Anchors Preset" property to "Full Rect" so that the background would take up the whole game screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the wall scene, I set up a <code>StaticBody2D</code> with a rectangular <code>CollisionShape2D</code> that extended the full
                    length of the viewport window. The sprites were simple white bars I designed in Aseprite.

                <p>
                    Finally, the divider is a <code>Sprite2D</code> of a dotted line that I placed in the main game scene.

                    The paddle is a <code>CharacterBody2D</code> that is set up so that P1 uses WASD and P2 uses the arrow keys. To check for these
                    inputs, I exported a variable called <code>player</code> that gets set in the main scene for both paddles. In <code>_physics_process()</code>,
                    the inputs are checked via string formatting so that when W or S are pressed, the conditional will only evaluate to true for P1 (and likewise for P2):

                    Ball

                    The ball took a few attempts to get right. Originally, I tried using a <code>RigidBody2D</code> but quickly realized that collisions
                    would be very messy to handle due to the node's physics, so I switched to an <code>Area2D</code>. Unfortunately, vector reflection on collisions
                    started getting confusing with that node, so I ultimately ended up using a <code>CharacterBody2D</code> to fully control motion and have collision
                    baked in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In <code>_ready()</code>, I initialize the ball's X and Y velocities to random values between 25 and 75. Then in <code>_physics_process()</code>,
                    I simply <code>mode_and_collide()</code> the ball. When a collision is detected, the velocity vector is updated to bounce off of the normal of the
                    collided surface. This accomplishes a very barebones collision system for now.

                    func _physics_process(delta):

                        if collision_info:
                            var normal = collision_info.get_normal()
                            velocity = velocity.bounce(normal)

                <p>
                    I added a <code>VisibleOnScreenNotifier2D</code> to the ball for detecting when the ball goes off screen with the <code>screen_exited()</code> signal.
                    To the ball's code, I added a <code>signal match_over(winner)</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The winner of a match is determined by the ball's X-velocity when it exits the screen. If the ball is traveling to the right, then P1 wins the round; if the ball
                    is traveling to the left, then P2 wins. When the <code>screen_exited()</code> signal is detected, this winner is calculated and the <code>match_over()</code> signal
                    is emitted. Finally, <code>queue_free()</code> is called to delete the ball instance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the main scene, <code>match_over()</code> is detected and a new variable <code>score</code> is updated for the player that won.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To handle respawning the ball, I removed the ball from the main scene and rewrote code to instantiate balls in main via code. The <code>spawn_ball()</code> function
                    instantiates a <code>ball_scene</code>, sets its position, and connects the <code>match_over</code> signal to <code>_on_ball_match_over()</code> in main. This function is
                    called in <code>_ready()</code> and <code>_on_ball_match_over()</code> to endlessly loop spawning balls.
